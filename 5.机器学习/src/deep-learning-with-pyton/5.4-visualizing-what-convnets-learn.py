# # Visualizing what convnets learn
# 
# This notebook contains the code sample found in Chapter 5, Section 4 of [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff). Note that the original text features far more content, in particular further explanations and figures: in this notebook, you will only find source code and related comments.
# 
# ----
# 
# It is often said that deep learning models are "black boxes", learning representations that are difficult to extract and present in a 
# human-readable form. While this is partially true for certain types of deep learning models, it is definitely not true for convnets. The 
# representations learned by convnets are highly amenable to visualization, in large part because they are _representations of visual 
# concepts_. Since 2013, a wide array of techniques have been developed for visualizing and interpreting these representations. We won't 
# survey all of them, but we will cover three of the most accessible and useful ones:
# 
# * Visualizing intermediate convnet outputs ("intermediate activations"). This is useful to understand how successive convnet layers 
# transform their input, and to get a first idea of the meaning of individual convnet filters.
# * Visualizing convnets filters. This is useful to understand precisely what visual pattern or concept each filter in a convnet is receptive 
# to.
# * Visualizing heatmaps of class activation in an image. This is useful to understand which part of an image where identified as belonging 
# to a given class, and thus allows to localize objects in images.
# 
# For the first method -- activation visualization -- we will use the small convnet that we trained from scratch on the cat vs. dog 
# classification problem two sections ago. For the next two methods, we will use the VGG16 model that we introduced in the previous section.

# ## Visualizing intermediate activations
# 
# Visualizing intermediate activations consists in displaying the feature maps that are output by various convolution and pooling layers in a 
# network, given a certain input (the output of a layer is often called its "activation", the output of the activation function). This gives 
# a view into how an input is decomposed unto the different filters learned by the network. These feature maps we want to visualize have 3 
# dimensions: width, height, and depth (channels). Each channel encodes relatively independent features, so the proper way to visualize these 
# feature maps is by independently plotting the contents of every channel, as a 2D image.
# Let's start by loading the model that we saved in section 5.2:

# In[2]:


from keras.models import load_model

model = load_model('cats_and_dogs_small_2.h5')
model.summary()  # As a reminder.


# This will be the input image we will use -- a picture of a cat, not part of images that the network was trained on:

# In[3]:


img_path = '/Users/fchollet/Downloads/cats_and_dogs_small/test/cats/cat.1700.jpg'

# We preprocess the image into a 4D tensor
from keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(150, 150))
img_tensor = image.img_to_array(img)
img_tensor = np.expand_dims(img_tensor, axis=0)
# Remember that the model was trained on inputs
# that were preprocessed in the following way:
img_tensor /= 255.

# Its shape is (1, 150, 150, 3)
print(img_tensor.shape)


# Let's display our picture:

# In[4]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.imshow(img_tensor[0])
plt.show()


# In order to extract the feature maps we want to look at, we will create a Keras model that takes batches of images as input, and outputs 
# the activations of all convolution and pooling layers. To do this, we will use the Keras class `Model`. A `Model` is instantiated using two 
# arguments: an input tensor (or list of input tensors), and an output tensor (or list of output tensors). The resulting class is a Keras 
# model, just like the `Sequential` models that you are familiar with, mapping the specified inputs to the specified outputs. What sets the 
# `Model` class apart is that it allows for models with multiple outputs, unlike `Sequential`. For more information about the `Model` class, see 
# Chapter 7, Section 1.

# In[5]:


from keras import models

# Extracts the outputs of the top 8 layers:
layer_outputs = [layer.output for layer in model.layers[:8]]
# Creates a model that will return these outputs, given the model input:
activation_model = models.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=layer_outputs)


# When fed an image input, this model returns the values of the layer activations in the original model. This is the first time you encounter 
# a multi-output model in this book: until now the models you have seen only had exactly one input and one output. In the general case, a 
# model could have any number of inputs and outputs. This one has one input and 8 outputs, one output per layer activation.

# In[6]:


# This will return a list of 5 Numpy arrays:
# one array per layer activation
activations = activation_model.predict(img_tensor)


# For instance, this is the activation of the first convolution layer for our cat image input:

# In[7]:


first_layer_activation = activations[0]
print(first_layer_activation.shape)


# It's a 148x148 feature map with 32 channels. Let's try visualizing the 3rd channel:

# In[8]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.matshow(first_layer_activation[0, :, :, 3], cmap='viridis')
plt.show()


# This channel appears to encode a diagonal edge detector. Let's try the 30th channel -- but note that your own channels may vary, since the 
# specific filters learned by convolution layers are not deterministic.

# In[9]:


plt.matshow(first_layer_activation[0, :, :, 30], cmap='viridis')
plt.show()


# This one looks like a "bright green dot" detector, useful to encode cat eyes. At this point, let's go and plot a complete visualization of 
# all the activations in the network. We'll extract and plot every channel in each of our 8 activation maps, and we will stack the results in 
# one big image tensor, with channels stacked side by side.

# In[10]:


import keras

# These are the names of the layers, so can have them as part of our plot
layer_names = []
for layer in model.layers[:8]:
    layer_names.append(layer.name)

images_per_row = 16

# Now let's display our feature maps
for layer_name, layer_activation in zip(layer_names, activations):
    # This is the number of features in the feature map
    n_features = layer_activation.shape[-1]

    # The feature map has shape (1, size, size, n_features)
    size = layer_activation.shape[1]

    # We will tile the activation channels in this matrix
    n_cols = n_features // images_per_row
    display_grid = np.zeros((size * n_cols, images_per_row * size))

    # We'll tile each filter into this big horizontal grid
    for col in range(n_cols):
        for row in range(images_per_row):
            channel_image = layer_activation[0,
                                             :, :,
                                             col * images_per_row + row]
            # Post-process the feature to make it visually palatable
            channel_image -= channel_image.mean()
            channel_image /= channel_image.std()
            channel_image *= 64
            channel_image += 128
            channel_image = np.clip(channel_image, 0, 255).astype('uint8')
            display_grid[col * size : (col + 1) * size,
                         row * size : (row + 1) * size] = channel_image

    # Display the grid
    scale = 1. / size
    plt.figure(figsize=(scale * display_grid.shape[1],
                        scale * display_grid.shape[0]))
    plt.title(layer_name)
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(display_grid, aspect='auto', cmap='viridis')
    
plt.show()


# A few remarkable things to note here:
# 
# * The first layer acts as a collection of various edge detectors. At that stage, the activations are still retaining almost all of the 
# information present in the initial picture.
# * As we go higher-up, the activations become increasingly abstract and less visually interpretable. They start encoding higher-level 
# concepts such as "cat ear" or "cat eye". Higher-up presentations carry increasingly less information about the visual contents of the 
# image, and increasingly more information related to the class of the image.
# * The sparsity of the activations is increasing with the depth of the layer: in the first layer, all filters are activated by the input 
# image, but in the following layers more and more filters are blank. This means that the pattern encoded by the filter isn't found in the 
# input image.

# 
# We have just evidenced a very important universal characteristic of the representations learned by deep neural networks: the features 
# extracted by a layer get increasingly abstract with the depth of the layer. The activations of layers higher-up carry less and less 
# information about the specific input being seen, and more and more information about the target (in our case, the class of the image: cat 
# or dog). A deep neural network effectively acts as an __information distillation pipeline__, with raw data going in (in our case, RBG 
# pictures), and getting repeatedly transformed so that irrelevant information gets filtered out (e.g. the specific visual appearance of the 
# image) while useful information get magnified and refined (e.g. the class of the image).
# 
# This is analogous to the way humans and animals perceive the world: after observing a scene for a few seconds, a human can remember which 
# abstract objects were present in it (e.g. bicycle, tree) but could not remember the specific appearance of these objects. In fact, if you 
# tried to draw a generic bicycle from mind right now, chances are you could not get it even remotely right, even though you have seen 
# thousands of bicycles in your lifetime. Try it right now: this effect is absolutely real. You brain has learned to completely abstract its 
# visual input, to transform it into high-level visual concepts while completely filtering out irrelevant visual details, making it 
# tremendously difficult to remember how things around us actually look.

# ## Visualizing convnet filters
# 
# 
# Another easy thing to do to inspect the filters learned by convnets is to display the visual pattern that each filter is meant to respond 
# to. This can be done with __gradient ascent in input space__: applying __gradient descent__ to the value of the input image of a convnet so 
# as to maximize the response of a specific filter, starting from a blank input image. The resulting input image would be one that the chosen 
# filter is maximally responsive to.
# 
# The process is simple: we will build a loss function that maximizes the value of a given filter in a given convolution layer, then we 
# will use stochastic gradient descent to adjust the values of the input image so as to maximize this activation value. For instance, here's 
# a loss for the activation of filter 0 in the layer "block3_conv1" of the VGG16 network, pre-trained on ImageNet:

# In[12]:


from keras.applications import VGG16
from keras import backend as K

model = VGG16(weights='imagenet',
              include_top=False)

layer_name = 'block3_conv1'
filter_index = 0

layer_output = model.get_layer(layer_name).output
loss = K.mean(layer_output[:, :, :, filter_index])


# To implement gradient descent, we will need the gradient of this loss with respect to the model's input. To do this, we will use the 
# `gradients` function packaged with the `backend` module of Keras:

# In[13]:


# The call to `gradients` returns a list of tensors (of size 1 in this case)
# hence we only keep the first element -- which is a tensor.
grads = K.gradients(loss, model.input)[0]


# A non-obvious trick to use for the gradient descent process to go smoothly is to normalize the gradient tensor, by dividing it by its L2 
# norm (the square root of the average of the square of the values in the tensor). This ensures that the magnitude of the updates done to the 
# input image is always within a same range.

# In[14]:


# We add 1e-5 before dividing so as to avoid accidentally dividing by 0.
grads /= (K.sqrt(K.mean(K.square(grads))) + 1e-5)


# Now we need a way to compute the value of the loss tensor and the gradient tensor, given an input image. We can define a Keras backend 
# function to do this: `iterate` is a function that takes a Numpy tensor (as a list of tensors of size 1) and returns a list of two Numpy 
# tensors: the loss value and the gradient value.

# In[15]:


iterate = K.function([model.input], [loss, grads])

# Let's test it:
import numpy as np
loss_value, grads_value = iterate([np.zeros((1, 150, 150, 3))])


# At this point we can define a Python loop to do stochastic gradient descent:

# In[16]:


# We start from a gray image with some noise
input_img_data = np.random.random((1, 150, 150, 3)) * 20 + 128.

# Run gradient ascent for 40 steps
step = 1.  # this is the magnitude of each gradient update
for i in range(40):
    # Compute the loss value and gradient value
    loss_value, grads_value = iterate([input_img_data])
    # Here we adjust the input image in the direction that maximizes the loss
    input_img_data += grads_value * step


# The resulting image tensor will be a floating point tensor of shape `(1, 150, 150, 3)`, with values that may not be integer within `[0, 
# 255]`. Hence we would need to post-process this tensor to turn it into a displayable image. We do it with the following straightforward 
# utility function:

# In[17]:


def deprocess_image(x):
    # normalize tensor: center on 0., ensure std is 0.1
    x -= x.mean()
    x /= (x.std() + 1e-5)
    x *= 0.1

    # clip to [0, 1]
    x += 0.5
    x = np.clip(x, 0, 1)

    # convert to RGB array
    x *= 255
    x = np.clip(x, 0, 255).astype('uint8')
    return x


# Now we have all the pieces, let's put them together into a Python function that takes as input a layer name and a filter index, and that 
# returns a valid image tensor representing the pattern that maximizes the activation the specified filter:

# In[18]:


def generate_pattern(layer_name, filter_index, size=150):
    # Build a loss function that maximizes the activation
    # of the nth filter of the layer considered.
    layer_output = model.get_layer(layer_name).output
    loss = K.mean(layer_output[:, :, :, filter_index])

    # Compute the gradient of the input picture wrt this loss
    grads = K.gradients(loss, model.input)[0]

    # Normalization trick: we normalize the gradient
    grads /= (K.sqrt(K.mean(K.square(grads))) + 1e-5)

    # This function returns the loss and grads given the input picture
    iterate = K.function([model.input], [loss, grads])
    
    # We start from a gray image with some noise
    input_img_data = np.random.random((1, size, size, 3)) * 20 + 128.

    # Run gradient ascent for 40 steps
    step = 1.
    for i in range(40):
        loss_value, grads_value = iterate([input_img_data])
        input_img_data += grads_value * step
        
    img = input_img_data[0]
    return deprocess_image(img)


# Let's try this:

# In[19]:


plt.imshow(generate_pattern('block3_conv1', 0))
plt.show()


# It seems that filter 0 in layer `block3_conv1` is responsive to a polka dot pattern.
# 
# Now the fun part: we can start visualising every single filter in every layer. For simplicity, we will only look at the first 64 filters in 
# each layer, and will only look at the first layer of each convolution block (block1_conv1, block2_conv1, block3_conv1, block4_conv1, 
# block5_conv1). We will arrange the outputs on a 8x8 grid of 64x64 filter patterns, with some black margins between each filter pattern.

# In[22]:


for layer_name in ['block1_conv1', 'block2_conv1', 'block3_conv1', 'block4_conv1']:
    size = 64
    margin = 5

    # This a empty (black) image where we will store our results.
    results = np.zeros((8 * size + 7 * margin, 8 * size + 7 * margin, 3))

    for i in range(8):  # iterate over the rows of our results grid
        for j in range(8):  # iterate over the columns of our results grid
            # Generate the pattern for filter `i + (j * 8)` in `layer_name`
            filter_img = generate_pattern(layer_name, i + (j * 8), size=size)

            # Put the result in the square `(i, j)` of the results grid
            horizontal_start = i * size + i * margin
            horizontal_end = horizontal_start + size
            vertical_start = j * size + j * margin
            vertical_end = vertical_start + size
            results[horizontal_start: horizontal_end, vertical_start: vertical_end, :] = filter_img

    # Display the results grid
    plt.figure(figsize=(20, 20))
    plt.imshow(results)
    plt.show()


# These filter visualizations tell us a lot about how convnet layers see the world: each layer in a convnet simply learns a collection of 
# filters such that their inputs can be expressed as a combination of the filters. This is similar to how the Fourier transform decomposes 
# signals onto a bank of cosine functions. The filters in these convnet filter banks get increasingly complex and refined as we go higher-up 
# in the model:
# 
# * The filters from the first layer in the model (`block1_conv1`) encode simple directional edges and colors (or colored edges in some 
# cases).
# * The filters from `block2_conv1` encode simple textures made from combinations of edges and colors.
# * The filters in higher-up layers start resembling textures found in natural images: feathers, eyes, leaves, etc.

# ## Visualizing heatmaps of class activation
# 
# We will introduce one more visualization technique, one that is useful for understanding which parts of a given image led a convnet to its 
# final classification decision. This is helpful for "debugging" the decision process of a convnet, in particular in case of a classification 
# mistake. It also allows you to locate specific objects in an image.
# 
# This general category of techniques is called "Class Activation Map" (CAM) visualization, and consists in producing heatmaps of "class 
# activation" over input images. A "class activation" heatmap is a 2D grid of scores associated with an specific output class, computed for 
# every location in any input image, indicating how important each location is with respect to the class considered. For instance, given a 
# image fed into one of our "cat vs. dog" convnet, Class Activation Map visualization allows us to generate a heatmap for the class "cat", 
# indicating how cat-like different parts of the image are, and likewise for the class "dog", indicating how dog-like differents parts of the 
# image are.
# 
# The specific implementation we will use is the one described in [Grad-CAM: Why did you say that? Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via 
# Gradient-based Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391). It is very simple: it consists in taking the output feature map of a 
# convolution layer given an input image, and weighing every channel in that feature map by the gradient of the class with respect to the 
# channel. Intuitively, one way to understand this trick is that we are weighting a spatial map of "how intensely the input image activates 
# different channels" by "how important each channel is with regard to the class", resulting in a spatial map of "how intensely the input 
# image activates the class".
# 
# We will demonstrate this technique using the pre-trained VGG16 network again:

# In[24]:


from keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16

K.clear_session()

# Note that we are including the densely-connected classifier on top;
# all previous times, we were discarding it.
model = VGG16(weights='imagenet')


# Let's consider the following image of two African elephants, possible a mother and its cub, strolling in the savanna (under a Creative 
# Commons license):
# 
# ![elephants](https://s3.amazonaws.com/book.keras.io/img/ch5/creative_commons_elephant.jpg)

# Let's convert this image into something the VGG16 model can read: the model was trained on images of size 224x244, preprocessed according 
# to a few rules that are packaged in the utility function `keras.applications.vgg16.preprocess_input`. So we need to load the image, resize 
# it to 224x224, convert it to a Numpy float32 tensor, and apply these pre-processing rules.

# In[27]:


from keras.preprocessing import image
from keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
import numpy as np

# The local path to our target image
img_path = '/Users/fchollet/Downloads/creative_commons_elephant.jpg'

# `img` is a PIL image of size 224x224
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))

# `x` is a float32 Numpy array of shape (224, 224, 3)
x = image.img_to_array(img)

# We add a dimension to transform our array into a "batch"
# of size (1, 224, 224, 3)
x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)

# Finally we preprocess the batch
# (this does channel-wise color normalization)
x = preprocess_input(x)


# In[29]:


preds = model.predict(x)
print('Predicted:', decode_predictions(preds, top=3)[0])


# 
# The top-3 classes predicted for this image are:
# 
# * African elephant (with 92.5% probability)
# * Tusker (with 7% probability)
# * Indian elephant (with 0.4% probability)
# 
# Thus our network has recognized our image as containing an undetermined quantity of African elephants. The entry in the prediction vector 
# that was maximally activated is the one corresponding to the "African elephant" class, at index 386:

# In[30]:


np.argmax(preds[0])


# To visualize which parts of our image were the most "African elephant"-like, let's set up the Grad-CAM process:

# In[31]:


# This is the "african elephant" entry in the prediction vector
african_elephant_output = model.output[:, 386]

# The is the output feature map of the `block5_conv3` layer,
# the last convolutional layer in VGG16
last_conv_layer = model.get_layer('block5_conv3')

# This is the gradient of the "african elephant" class with regard to
# the output feature map of `block5_conv3`
grads = K.gradients(african_elephant_output, last_conv_layer.output)[0]

# This is a vector of shape (512,), where each entry
# is the mean intensity of the gradient over a specific feature map channel
pooled_grads = K.mean(grads, axis=(0, 1, 2))

# This function allows us to access the values of the quantities we just defined:
# `pooled_grads` and the output feature map of `block5_conv3`,
# given a sample image
iterate = K.function([model.input], [pooled_grads, last_conv_layer.output[0]])

# These are the values of these two quantities, as Numpy arrays,
# given our sample image of two elephants
pooled_grads_value, conv_layer_output_value = iterate([x])

# We multiply each channel in the feature map array
# by "how important this channel is" with regard to the elephant class
for i in range(512):
    conv_layer_output_value[:, :, i] *= pooled_grads_value[i]

# The channel-wise mean of the resulting feature map
# is our heatmap of class activation
heatmap = np.mean(conv_layer_output_value, axis=-1)


# For visualization purpose, we will also normalize the heatmap between 0 and 1:

# In[32]:


heatmap = np.maximum(heatmap, 0)
heatmap /= np.max(heatmap)
plt.matshow(heatmap)
plt.show()


# Finally, we will use OpenCV to generate an image that superimposes the original image with the heatmap we just obtained:

# In[ ]:


import cv2

# We use cv2 to load the original image
img = cv2.imread(img_path)

# We resize the heatmap to have the same size as the original image
heatmap = cv2.resize(heatmap, (img.shape[1], img.shape[0]))

# We convert the heatmap to RGB
heatmap = np.uint8(255 * heatmap)

# We apply the heatmap to the original image
heatmap = cv2.applyColorMap(heatmap, cv2.COLORMAP_JET)

# 0.4 here is a heatmap intensity factor
superimposed_img = heatmap * 0.4 + img

# Save the image to disk
cv2.imwrite('/Users/fchollet/Downloads/elephant_cam.jpg', superimposed_img)


# ![elephant cam](https://s3.amazonaws.com/book.keras.io/img/ch5/elephant_cam.jpg)

# This visualisation technique answers two important questions:
# 
# * Why did the network think this image contained an African elephant?
# * Where is the African elephant located in the picture?
# 
# In particular, it is interesting to note that the ears of the elephant cub are strongly activated: this is probably how the network can 
# tell the difference between African and Indian elephants.
#
